                       Located in the heart of San Francisco’s greenest landmark, this field blends nature with competition. With seating for up to 150 spectators and room for approximately 50 players on the sidelines, it’s ideal for weekend tournaments, youth leagues, and city rec games. The turf is soft yet fast—just like your game should be. Great for SFYSA matches, intramural leagues, or just that 9v9 game you organized over group chat 10 minutes ago.

Clean restrooms, casual pickup every Thursday, and street parking that’s surprisingly reasonable for Santa Monica. You’re practically scoring goals in paradise.
